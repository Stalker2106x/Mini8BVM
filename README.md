## Getting Started

### Building program

First, fetch git submodules:

    git submodule init --update

then, you need to build the FreeGLut (OpenGL) dependency:

    cd thirdparty/freeglut
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Move back to the root of the repository and start building the app.
 
    cd ../../
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

### Usage

For now, the software does not provide any configuration, come back later!
